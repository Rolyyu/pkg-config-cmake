# pkg-config-cmake

This is a Pkg-config example for using library like FFmpeg/x264/265 etc.

Pkg-config is available from [Freedesktop.org](http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/).

Pkg-config is necessary for detecting some of the libraries. It works on multiple platforms: Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, Mac OS X and Windows. It does not require anything but a reasonably well working C compiler and a C library, but can use an installed glib if that is present.
